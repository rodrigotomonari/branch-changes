## Features

- 🔍 **Real-time Change Tracking**: Automatically updates when files change, branches switch, or files are saved
- 🌳 **Hierarchical View**: Files are organized by folder structure for easier navigation
- 🔄 **Compare Any Two Branches**: Select which branch to compare against (defaults to main/master)
- 📊 **Color-coded Status**: Quickly identify staged, unstaged, and committed changes
- ⚡ **Auto-detection**: Automatically finds the most appropriate source branch
- 🖱️ **Click to Open**: Files open directly when clicked
